	<h2>Tools for Development of Apps for Internet of Things</h2>
	
	<p>EvoStudio is a set of development tools, designed for development of mobile apps using web technologies. EvoStudio is specifically designed to be used for development of apps for Internet of Things.
	
	<p>With EvoStudio you take advantage of HTML5 technologies and JavaScript to develop mobile web apps or hybrid apps - with very fast turn around time. Use any text editor or graphical editor to author HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As soon as you save, the app is instantly reloaded, and you can directly see the result. This also works with image editors.</p>
	
	<p>EvoStudio App is a native application you run on your mobile devices. It connects to EvoStudio to enable live editing of your HTML/CSS/JavaScript code. The EvoStudio App contains native functionality that is accessible from JavaScript, such as Bluetooth Low Energy.</p>

</div>

<div class="box">
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	
	<p><b>Very quick version:</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Click the "Run" button! If there is no browser or device connected, a web browser will be opened with the selected project. Note that mobile device native functionality is only available when you run your programs using the EvoStudio App.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>Slightly longer version:</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Download and install the EvoStudio App on your mobile devices.</li>
	<li>Launch the app and enter the URL shown in the bottom panel of the EvoStudio window and press "Connect". <b>Mobile devices must be on the same local WiFi network as this computer to be able connect!</b></li>
	<li>The app should now connect to EvoStudio and display the message "Connected".</li>
	<li>Now go to the EvoStudio window, and click the "Run" button of one of the demo apps. Does the mobile display the app you selected? If so, you are up and running!</li>
	<li>You can connect any number of mobile devices, and instantly see the result on each of them!</li>
	</ul>

</div>

<div class="box">
	<h2>Live Editing</h2>
	<p>To test the live editing feature of HyperReload, try out the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Click the "Open" button of one of the demo apps in the EvoStudio window, for instance the "Hello World" example.</li>
	<li>Open the file "index.html" in a text editor.</li>
	<li>Change something in the HTML code, for example, change the h1 heading to: &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
	<li>Save the file. The changes you made should be instantly displayed on connected devices.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="box">
	<h2>Creating Your Own Project</h2>
	<p>To add your own project to HyperReload, do this:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Open the folder with the HTML file that is the main file of your application (typically "index.html", but any name is fine). The file must be a valid HTML file and it must have extension ".html" or ".htm".</li>
	<li>Drag the file into the HyperReload window and drop it there.</li>
	<li>The file is now added as a project to HyperReload and you can run it.</li>
	<li>You can move project entries using drag and drop, and delete them by clicking the delete icon (this will not delete any files in your project folder).</li>
	<li>When clicking "Run" the files in that project folder is monitored, and the app is reloaded when any file is updated. Currently up to three levels of subdirectories are monitored. This can be configured in the file settings.js.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="box">
<h2>Connecting from Hybrid Apps</h2>

<p>You can use EvoStudio with hybrid apps, like Cordova apps. Just enter the URL displayed in the EvoStudio user interface to connect. For example:</p>

<pre>http://192.168.43.226:4042</pre>
    
<p>Here is an example of how to connect from an Android WebView:</p>

<pre>WebView mWebView = new WebView(this);
mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());
mWebView.loadUrl("http://192.168.43.226:4042");</pre>

<p>Make sure the WebView has JavaScript enabled, and that it has a WebViewClient (otherwise, URLs opened from within the WebView will be opened in an external browser, rather than in the WebView itself).</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
<h2>The Workbench</h2>

<p>Clicking the "Workbench" button open the JavaScript Workbench window. In the workbench, you can evaluate JavaScript code interactively on connected devices. Just select the code you wish to run, and press the "Eval" button. The selected code is sent to connected devices and evaluated. The return value is displayed in the bottom panel.</p>

<p>The Workbench is useful for experimenting with code snippets and for debugging. To display log messages from your code, use the hyper.log() function. The log message us displayed in the bottom panel. Exemple:</p>

<pre>hyper.log('Hello World')</pre>
    
<p>By using hyper.log() in your code (not just from the Workbench), you can output debug information from connected devices.</p>
